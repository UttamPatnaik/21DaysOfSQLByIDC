What i learned today!

LIMIT and OFFSET

Syntax:
SELECT columnsFROM table_name
LIMIT number_of_rows;
SELECT columnsFROM table_name
LIMIT number_of_rows OFFSET skip_rows;

Example:
First 10 records: SELECT * FROM patients LIMIT 10 OFFSET 0;
Next 10 records: SELECT * FROM patients LIMIT 10 OFFSET 10;
Next 10 records: SELECT * FROM patients LIMIT 10 OFFSET 20;

Practice Questions:
1. Display the first 5 patients from the patients table.
Query: SELECT * FROM patients LIMIT 5;
2. Show patients 11-20 using OFFSET.
Query: SELECT * FROM patients LIMIT 10 OFFSET 10;
3. Get the 10 most recent patient admissions based on arrival_date.
Query: SELECT * FROM patients ORDER BY arrival_date DESC LIMIT 10;

Daily Challenge: 
Question: Find the 3rd to 7th highest patient satisfaction scores from the patients table, showing patient_id, name, service, and satisfaction. Display only these 5 records.
Query: SELECT patient_id,name,service,satisfaction FROM patients ORDER BY satisfaction DESC LIMIT 5 OFFSET 2;
